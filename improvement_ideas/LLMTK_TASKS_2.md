### Potential Next Steps 

Now that we have this solid foundation, consider:

1. **Agent Learning Loop**
   ```yaml
   # Track which patterns agents successfully fix
   agent_feedback:
     pattern_id: "undefined_reference"
     fix_success_rate: 0.87
     average_attempts: 2.3
   ```

2. **Parallel Build Intelligence**
   - Detect and report build bottlenecks
   - Suggest parallelization improvements
   - Identify circular dependencies

3. **Cross-Project Learning**
   - Anonymous telemetry on common error patterns
   - Crowd-sourced fix patterns
   - Build time optimization strategies

4. **LLM Provider Adapters**
   ```bash
   llmtk export --format=claude  # Optimized for Claude's context window
   llmtk export --format=gpt4   # Optimized for GPT-4's structure
   ```

5. **Semantic Diff Analysis**
   - Beyond text diffs to AST-aware changes
   - Impact analysis for modifications
   - Suggest minimal test surface for changes

## Questions About Implementation

1. **SARIF Merge Strategy**: How does `sarif_merge.py` handle conflicting results from different tools analyzing the same issue?

2. **Cache Invalidation**: What's the strategy for cache invalidation in the incremental analysis? File timestamps, content hashing, or dependency tracking?

3. **Context Budget Algorithm**: How does the tiered context selection work? Is it rule-based or does it use some scoring mechanism?

4. **Performance Metrics**: Could we benchmark the context reduction effectiveness? What's the typical compression ratio?

## Community and Ecosystem

Consider:
- **Publishing benchmarks** comparing context sizes before/after optimization
- **Creating a plugin system** for custom analyzers
- **Building a community repository** of error patterns and fixes
- **Establishing integration examples** with popular AI coding tools

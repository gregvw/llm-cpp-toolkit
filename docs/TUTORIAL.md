# Agent-Guided Tutorial

This walkthrough shows how to install **llm-cpp-toolkit**, scaffold a deliberately broken C++ project, and iterate with an LLM/agent to bring it back to green by leaning on the toolkitâ€™s context packs, analyzers, and sanitized builds. Each stage calls out what the user does versus what the agent can automate once the artifacts exist.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: The tutorial assumes youâ€™re on Linux or macOS with a recent Clang/LLVM toolchain available. Substitute equivalent package commands if your distro differs.

## What Youâ€™ll Accomplish
- Install `llmtk` from the public repo and verify the environment with `llmtk doctor`.
- Generate a fresh CMake project (`buglab`) that follows the guidance encoded in `llmtk init`.
- Seed the project with code that contains both compile-time and runtime bugs.
- Produce context packs (`exports/â€¦`) and filtered build logs that an agent can consume without guesswork.
- Let the agent drive fixes: first for compiler diagnostics, then for AddressSanitizer/UBSan findings, and finally for static-analysis cleanups.

## 0. Prerequisites
- Linux or macOS shell with `curl`, `python3`, `cmake`, and either `clang` or `gcc`.
- Optional but recommended: `ninja`, `clang-tidy`, `cppcheck`, `include-what-you-use`.
- Network access to download the installer (or clone the repo beforehand).

If you are running inside a minimal container, install the toolchain first, e.g.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential clang ninja-build python3 curl git
```

## 1. Install llm-cpp-toolkit
Pick the path that matches your setup. The zero-dependency Bash installer is the quickest way to get started:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gregvw/llm-cpp-toolkit/main/install.sh | bash
llmtk --version
```

Other distributable options (Nix, Homebrew tap, Docker, etc.) are described in `docs/INSTALLATION.md`. Regardless of how you install, keep the repository handyâ€”you may want to inspect the shipped presets or manifests later.

## 2. Run the Health Check
With `llmtk` on your `PATH`, verify the host before creating a project:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/llmtk-workshop
cd ~/llmtk-workshop
llmtk doctor
```

`exports/doctor.json` now contains a structured summary of the discovered toolchain. Share that file (or its JSON payload) with your agent so it immediately knows which compilers and analyzers are available.

## 3. Scaffold a Playground Project
Create a new project named `buglab` using the full preset, which wires strict warnings, sanitizer targets, and lint presets:

```bash
llmtk init buglab --preset=full
cd buglab
```

The command writes a CMakeLists.txt aligned with `CMAKE_GUIDANCE.md`, a starter `main.cpp`, and regenerates `exports/capabilities.json` so agents can enumerate supported commands without scraping docs.

## 4. Verify the Build Manager CLI
The installer drops a companion CLI named `build_manager` into the same prefix as `llmtk`. It wraps configure/build/test with concise JSON summaries engineered for agents. Confirm itâ€™s available, then you can call it from anywhere:

```bash
build_manager --help | head
```

You should see the usage banner with `configure`, `build`, `test`, `clean`, and `full` subcommands.

## 5. Seed Some Bugs
Replace the generated `main.cpp` with intentionally problematic code. It contains:
- a `double` â†’ `int` narrowing conversion that trips `-Wconversion` (treated as an error),
- an out-of-bounds loop that will corrupt memory,
- a heap buffer overflow that AddressSanitizer will flag once the code builds.

```bash
cat <<'CODE' > main.cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::uint8_t scale(double value) {
    return value * 1.5; // implicit narrowing conversion (will be -Werror)
}

double average(const std::vector<int>& values) {
    if (values.empty()) {
        return 0.0;
    }

    int sum = 0;
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i <= values.size(); ++i) { // oops: off-by-one
        sum += values[i];
    }

    auto truncated = scale(sum);
    return static_cast<double>(truncated) / values.size();
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> data{1, 2, 3};
    std::cout << "Average: " << average(data) << "\n";

    int* buffer = new int[3];
    buffer[3] = 42; // heap overflow
    delete[] buffer;

    return 0;
}
CODE
```

## 6. Export Context for the Agent
Populate the compile database and CMake file API so `llmtk analyze` and external tools have something to chew on:

```bash
llmtk context export --build build
```

Artifacts you can hand to the agent now include:
- `exports/compile_commands.json`
- `exports/cmake-file-api/`
- `exports/context.json` (a rollup with timestamps and paths)

## 7. First Iteration â€” Fix the Compile Failure
Run a full configure/build cycle with the build manager. The strict warning set will stop the build on the implicit narrowing conversion:

```bash
build_manager full --no-tests
```

Expect a non-zero exit along with a log under `logs/`, e.g. `logs/build_20240830_153011.json`. The JSON captures compiler diagnostics such as:

```json
{
  "type": "compiler_diagnostic",
  "severity": "error",
  "file": "main.cpp",
  "line": 6,
  "column": 12,
  "message": "conversion from 'double' to 'std::uint8_t' may change value"
}
```

**Agent playbook:**
1. Inspect `logs/build_*json` (or the console summary) to pinpoint the failing diagnostic.
2. Propose a minimal patchâ€”e.g. change `scale` to return `double`, or switch to `std::lround` with a checked cast.
3. Have the user apply the patch and rerun `build_manager full --no-tests` until the compile stage succeeds.

Once the build passes, the manager prints `âœ… Build successful`. Sanitized targets still havenâ€™t runâ€”next!

## 8. Second Iteration â€” Catch the Runtime Crash
AddressSanitizer and UBSan variants are available out of the box thanks to the preset. Build and execute the ASan/UBSan clone of the target:

```bash
cmake --build build --target buglab_asan_ubsan
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1 UBSAN_OPTIONS=print_stacktrace=1 ./build/buglab_asan_ubsan
```

You should see output similar to:

```
==12345==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address ...
READ of size 4 at ... main.cpp:25
```

**Agent playbook:**
1. Parse the sanitizer report (either from stdout or by teeâ€™ing it into `exports/sanitizers/asan.log`).
2. Identify the two memory issues: the loopâ€™s `<=` bound and the `buffer[3]` write.
3. Recommend patches (tighten the loop condition, fix the buffer indexing, optionally replace the raw `new[]/delete[]` with `std::vector<int>`).
4. After applying the fixes, rebuild and rerun the sanitized binary to confirm the crash is gone.

## 9. Third Iteration â€” Static Analysis Cleanup
With the program building cleanly and sanitizers quiet, run the analyzer suite to ensure there are no lingering findings:

```bash
llmtk analyze main.cpp
```

The command emits JSON reports under `exports/reports/` for clang-tidy, IWYU, and cppcheck. Hand them to the agent so it can double-check that no warnings remain. If clang-tidy suggests style or safety improvements (e.g. using `std::size_t` consistently), fold them in and rerun the command.

## 10. Wrap-Up and Next Steps
- Regenerate the project capabilities summary after major changes:

  ```bash
  llmtk capabilities
  ```

- Capture a final build/test transcript for provenance:

  ```bash
  build_manager full
  cmake --build build --target buglab_tsan    # optional: thread sanitizer
  llmtk context export --build build          # refresh context after fixes
  llmtk analyze .
  ```

- Share the updated `exports/` directory and `logs/` folder with your agent. They are intentionally machine-readable so any LLM can resume work without rerunning expensive steps.

From here you can evolve `buglab` into a richer playgroundâ€”add unit tests, wire `llmtk reduce` around failing cases, or script the whole loop in CI. The key pattern is the same: keep artifacts deterministic, keep outputs in `exports/`, and let the agent reason from the JSON instead of raw terminal scrollback.
